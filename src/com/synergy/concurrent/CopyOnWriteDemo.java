		 * that a thread that is looping through the elements in a collection
		 * must keep a reference to the same unchanging elements throughout the
		 * duration of the loop; this is achieved with the use of an Iterator.
		 * Basically, you want to keep using the old, unchanging collection that
		 * you began a loop with. When you use list.iterator(), the returned
		 * Iterator will always reference the collection of elements as it was
		 * when list.iterator() was called, even if another thread modifies the
		 * collection. Any mutating methods called on a copy-on-writeâ€“based
		 * Iterator or ListIterator (such as add, set, or remove) will throw an
		 * UnsupportedOperationException.
